# GitSearch

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.1.
It helps users find git accounts and find any codes on github

## Project's aim;
I created this project mainly for it to make easier finding accounts containing codes one may need on github. You could also find alternatives aas you code by getting ideas from accounts searched by my app .

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
